rban policy formed a prominent part of its election platform. The new Prime Minister said, in a political speech: "... no amount of wealth redistribution through higher wages or lower taxes can really offset the inequalities imposed by the physical nature of cities. Increasingly, a citizen's real standard of living, the health of himself and his family, his children's opportunities for education and self-improvement, his access to employment opportunities, his ability to enjoy the nation's resources for recreation and culture ... are determined not by his income, but by where he lives" (Whitlam, quoted by Logan et al, 1975, pages 106-107). 'Inequality' had been redefined partly as a function of residential locationâ€”where people live and how
accessible they are to the jobs, goods, and services of the city (Catley and McFarlane,
1974; Sandercock, 1975).
